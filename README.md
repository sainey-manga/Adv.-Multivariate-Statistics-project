# Adv.-Multivariate-Statistics-project
This project was submitted as a course evaluation for the Adv. multivariate statistics course.

Using the Country dataset from kaggle, I implemented k-means clustering and model based clustering in order to cluster countries in to similar countries.
This is to classify countries into poor, midlle class and developed countries. Additionally, I had also compared the pperformance of the two models.
